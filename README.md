# Co-op Maze Game

A local 2-player cooperative maze game built in Unity for a 48-hour game jam.

## 🎮 Game Concept

Two players are trapped in separate halves of a mysterious maze.  
They must **cooperate**, **solve puzzles**, and **help each other** using keys, doors, and coins in order to **meet at the center** and win.

Each player has their own first-person view and controls, and can influence the other player's environment. Communication is essential!

## 🕹️ Controls

### Player 1
- Move: `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`
- Look: Mouse
- Teleport Player 2 to your location: `G`
- Toggle flashlight: `T`

### Player 2
- Move: Arrow keys
- Look: Numpad `4` / `6` / `8` / `2`
- Teleport Player 1 to your location: `L`
- Toggle flashlight: `P`

## 🧩 Game Mechanics

- **Keys** open doors for the other player.
- **Doors** block paths until opened by the partner.
- **Coins** add extra time to the shared countdown timer.
- Players **must meet in the center of the maze** to win.

## 👥 Multiplayer

This is a **local multiplayer** game. Both players play on the **same machine**, each with their own half of the screen, controls, and camera.
